# SmartConstraints

SmartContraints is a Java annotation 
processor that collects validation 
constraints from your entities and
 generates corresponding meta annotations. 
 You can then use them easily in your DTOs. 

 ## How-To

Add the `smartconstraints-annotation` as 
a compile time dependency to your project.
(Not required at runtime) 

Add the `@CopyConstraints` annotation 
on a `package-info.javaË‹ in jour project, 
where meta-annotations will be generated. 

Add the `from` attribute to `@CopyConstraints` 
and specify the package where your entities
are located. 

Add the `smartconstraints-annotationprocessor`
As a compile time dependency to your project. 
(Not required at runtime) 

Run your build :-)

You can now use annotations like :
`@Address.StreetName` on your DTOs that
aggregates validations from original
 field , without any runtime 
dependency to `AddressEntity`. 

## Notes

SmartContraints as been designed as a
 tool to help adoption of 
CleanArchitecture principles.  

SmartConstraints also works with source
entities located in third party libraries. 

## Requirements

You project must be a least a Java 11 project.

Your project must use `javax.validation.constraints.*` annotations.
